# Python_Fundamental_Assignments
This capstone project from a Python Programming crash course showcases key foundational aspects of Python through a series of tasks. The project is broken down as follows:

Task One: Demonstrates a clear understanding of Python's various data types and their uses.

Task Two: Highlights the functionality of loops and conditionals. In this part, a while loop and if-else statements are used to illustrate control flow.

Task Three: A simple calculator that allows users to enter two values and choose an operation to perform, demonstrating interactive input and basic arithmetic operations.

Task Four: A basic TO-DO list application enabling users to add, delete, and view tasks. This task incorporates core concepts such as loops, conditional statements, functions, and file handling, providing a comprehensive exercise in Python programming.
